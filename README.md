# String List Undo Method
This C++ project implements a dynamic array class called Stringlist, which allows you to create and manipulate an array of strings. The focus of the project is a special method of the Stringlist class called `undo` which allows the user to undo operations conducted on the Stringlist array. This allows users to dynamically manipulate a list of strings, such as adding, removing, copying, and shifting strings, and undoing these operations as they see fit.
